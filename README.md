# NovelScript-Engine

This is my attempt of making a javascript visual novel engine.

Now let's get _This_ straight:

- _This_ is an engine to use as a dependency to your project or visual novel.
- _This_ is more like a library and less like an engine but it provides all the necessary tools for creating a complex visual novel.
- _This_ only helps you create your visual novel and can't do everything by itself.
- _This_ won't create everything for you.

## FAQs

### What stage are we in right now?

Ready to start strong.

### Can you depend on this project to be done for your visual novel?

No but this should be completed sooner than Incel Highschool since we need a more complex engine than Ren'Py.

### Why make this?

I was having trouble with Ren'Py since I wanted more than just dialogue and a story. I wanted to create gameplay for downtimes in my visual novels and expand more on what the player could do.

### Is this going to be cross-platform?

Fortunately yes, since Electron and Node.js are cross-platform then this can easily be used as a library in most cases.

### How can I contribute?

Right now you can give me feedback and suggestions on our discord. [Join us](https://discord.gg/4H6Mfh)
